The *normal* way to cut the images is to cut it in *"tiles"*, but this approach suffers from computational inefficiency and can result in discontinuities at output boundaries to overcome this problem, and substantially reduce the negative impacts of label stitching, by **artificially increasing the input-patch size of CNNs only during label inferenc**.

They propose an approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. They evaluate the performance in comparaison of a conventional stitching approach using two segmentation models and two large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets.

The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases.

## Models
