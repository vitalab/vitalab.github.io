# Contribution

The authors propose a new set of learnable filters for extracting
both **location** and **orientation** of a specific white matter bundle
in the human brain. In that sense, their proposal combines the ideas
of bundle specific tracking and pure bundle segmentation.

As opposed to common deep learning approaches, their filter needs only
a few parameters to map 12 chosen bundles (1e3 for HAMLET vs 1e6 for common
CNN implementations in other tasks).

Further, their approach makes use of covariance properties of the data,
i.e. translation as well as rotation covariance.

These two factors enable their filter to be trained with a relatively
modest number of training samples.

# Covariant Non-linear filters based on Spherical Tensor Algebra

#### Prereqisites

 * **Spherical tensor fields**

   $$x(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{n}) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \mathbf{a}^j(\mathbf{r})^\mathsf{T}
                                                  \mathbf{Y}^j(\mathbf{n})$$.

  * $$\mathbf{Y}^j: S_2 \mapsto \mathbb{C}^{2j+1}$$ are SH basis functions
    of order *j*.
  * $$\mathbf{a}^j: \mathbb{R}^3 \mapsto \mathbb{C}^{2j+1}$$ is a
    *spherical tensor field*.

 * **Spherical product**

   The authors define a spherical product
   $$\circ_j : \mathbb{C}^{2j_1+1} \times \mathbb{C}^{2j_2+1}
     \mapsto \mathbb{C}^{2j+1}$$
   which is ***rotationally covariant*** in the sense of

   $$(\mathbf{D}^{j_1}(g)\mathbf{v}) \circ_j (\mathbf{D}^{j_2}(g)
     \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{D}^j(g)(\mathbf{v} \circ_j \mathbf{w})$$,

   where $$\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^{2j_1+1}$$,
         $$\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{C}^{2j_2+1}$$ and
         $$g \in SO(3)$$ and
         $$\mathbf{D}^j(g)$$ is the *Wigner-D* matrix.

 * **Spherical differential operator**

   Given the *solid harmonics* defined by the homogeneous polynomials
   $$R_m^j(\mathbf{r}) = r^jY^j_m(\mathbf{n})$$ (where $$r = |\mathbf{r}|$$
   and $$\mathbf{n} = \frac{\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|}$$), they further
   define a *spherical differential operator*

   $$\mathbf{\partial}^j := (\partial^j_{-j}, ..., \partial^j_{j})$$,

   where $$\partial^j_m := R^j_m(\nabla)$$ on the basis of spherical
   products.

   The authors emphasise that this *"operator can be used to linearly
   map" spherical tensor fields "onto other" spherical tensor fields
   "by intertwining spatial neighbourhood information"*.

#### Filter composition

 The proposed filters are composed similarly to the layers of a
 conventional CNN. They feature a **linear filter** with invariance
 properties, a **non-linear transformation** as well as linear
 combination of **several channels**.

 * **Input**

   The filters input is composed of the collection of spherical tensor
   fields given by the expansion of the raw dMRI signal in the
   spherical harmonics basis. In their experiments, the authors use
   only order 0th and 2nd order coefficients resulting in

   $$D = \{\mathbf{a}^0, \mathbf{a^2}\}$$.

 * **A.** **Linear features**

   The linear features are obtained by convolving the spherical tensor
   fields with a Gaussian (*g*) and projecting the result onto the basis
   defined by $$\partial^L \circ_j g$$. These features are given as

   $$\mathbf{b}_{J, L, j, g} = \partial^L \circ_J (g \ast \mathbf{a}^j)$$.

 * **B.** **Non-linearity** and mapping to 2nd order tensor

   Subsequently, non-linearity is achieved by considering spherical
   products of these linear features. Since the authors assume single
   bundles to be sufficiently represented by 2nd order tensors locally,
   they map the spherical products back to order two, resulting in
   the feature maps

   $$\mathbf{f}_j(\mathbf{b}_I, \mathbf{b}_{I'}) = \partial^L \circ_2
                    (g \ast (\mathbf{b}_I \circ_j \mathbf{b}_{I'})$$.

 * **C.** **Linear combination** of *channels*

   Finally, the features of different *channels* are linearly combined
   to obtain the final filter output $$\mathbf{y}$$ as

   $$\mathbf{y}(D) = \sum_{j, I, I'} \alpha_{jII'} \mathbf{f}_j(\mathbf{b}_I,
                          \mathbf{b}_{I'})$$.

#### Hierarchical composition

 Since the filters are applied in a multi-resolution approach (see
 overview figure above) it is necessary to specify how features are
 forwarded to subsequent scales.

 Given the results on scale *s*, the filter output on scale $$s+1$$ is
 obtained by

 $$\mathbf{y}^{s+1} := \kappa^s\mathbf{y}^s
      + \vert\mathbf{y}^s\vert \sum_{j,I,I'} \alpha^s_{jII'} \mathbf{f}_j(\mathbf{b}^{s+1}_I,
                                                                  \mathbf{b}^{s+1}_{I'})
      + \sum_{j,I,k} \beta^s_{jIk} \mathbf{f}_j(\mathbf{b}^{s+1}_I, \mathbf{y}^s_k)$$,

 which is composed by

  * *a.* the features $$\mathbf{y}^s$$ from the previous scale *s*
  * *b.* the newly obtained features from scale $$s+1$$
  * *c.* a mixed term of features $$\mathbf{y}^s$$ from scale *s* and
         new linear features $$\mathbf{b}^{s+1}_I$$ from scale $$s+1$$.

 **Training**

 The parameters $$\kappa, \alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are learned during
 training.

 Given the "trace" of a "tract" the authors define their ground truth
 as the normalised density map. The unnormlised density map is obtained
 as

 $$\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_k \int \mathbf{Y}^2(\mathbf{n}(t))
   \delta(\mathbf{r}_k(t) - \mathbf{r})\mathrm{d}t$$,

 where $$\mathbf{r}_k$$ is the parameterisation of a "tract" (?) (check
 paper for details).

# Experiments

 The experiments are performed on two different data sets. Training
 is done on a high quality dataset on a Siemens PRISMA scanner
 (58 directions, b-value $$\in \{1000, 2000}$$ for 55 subjects. Testing
 (and retesting) uses a low quality data set from a TRIO scanner
 (60 directions, b-value ***unkown***) on 28 subjects in two sessions.

 **Ground truth** tractography is based on global tractography (check
 paper for more details). The authors choose 12 bundles to evaluate on.

#### Qualitative assessment on PRISMA test data

 Euler integration is used to obtain streamlines from HAMLET output.
 Thresholding of the output is performed by "optimising the segmentation
 accuracy".

 The comparison of tractography output for HAMLET and the ground truth
 a random test subject from the PRISMA data set is used. The authors
 find their results overall visually appealing. However, they acknowledge
 artifacts (yellow circles in the figure below) in the results of their
 own method. One source of error is high variability in the ground truth
 data which causes their output to have low confidence and therefore the
 thresholding is more prone to cut away parts of the bundle volume in such regions.

#### Test-retest and extrapolation to unseen acquisition protocol

 In a second experiment they assess HAMLET's

  * **a.** ability to generalise to different acquisition protocols
  * **b.** robustness to repeated measurements.

 The below figure shows test results of three subjects on the TRIO
 data set for HAMLET after training on PRISMA for the two acquisition
 time points.

 <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/article/images/HAMLET/retest_trio.jpg" width="700"></p>

 In order to quantify the retest reproducibility, they assess the
 "apparent tract volume" computed on the output of HAMLET which they
 define as "the squared power" of the output map **y** given by

 <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/article/images/HAMLET/eq_volume.jpg" width="80">.</p>

 Based on the correlation plots in the figure below, the authors aim to
 show the robustness of that measure (and thus their method) with respect
 to repeated measurements.
