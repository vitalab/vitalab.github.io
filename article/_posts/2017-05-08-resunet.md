This paper combines the [U-Net]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-02-27-unet.md %}) with [ResNet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-03-16-resnet.md %}).   Their main contribution is the use of "bottleneck block" and "simple block" layers which all contain dropout.

The authors show that the use of local skip connections allows to have similar results than state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters, without  any  post-processing, and without any class weighting.  They tested their method on the [EM (Electron Microscopy) ISBI 2012 challenge](http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/home) dataset.
