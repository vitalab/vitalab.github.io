## Summary

**Problem**: segment brain lesions with an unsupervised deep neural net.  The main difficulty is that lesions can be anywhere, have any shape and  any size. 

**Solution**: use a convolutional autoencoder which incorporate a "segmentation layer" before the output. (c.f.Fig.1)

## Specific details 

Due to space limitation, the authors process a brain patch-wise, each patch being a 80x80x80 volume.  For training, patches have a stride of 40 while at test time they use a stride of 20 (with an average of overlapping voxels).  The use the following reconstruction loss :

$$ L = (Y^p - \hat{Y}^p)^2 $$

with p=3.  A brainmask is applied before the loss so the background is
not considered.  Furthermore, Gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.05 was added to the input during training for noise
 robustness. 

 And last, the reason for having a "segmentation" layer before the output is explained as follows : 
 
 *The final convolutional layer is restricted
 to have positive weights and zero bias for the output reconstruction of the FLAIR patch to be a conical combination of
 the Segmentation layer.*

## Experiments

**Dataset:** 
- 4811 brain MRI, all with T1, T2 and FLAIR.
