## Summary

This paper presents a simple but apparently effective method for segmenting prostate MRI images.  As illustrated in fig.1, they use 2 CNNs.  The first **global** one roughly segments the prostate.  Based on that segmentation, they crop the image and feed it to a second **local** CNN.  The resulting segmentation map is then post-processed with basic morphological operations.

**NOTE** that their CNNs are UNet are some sort of denseNets with residual modules.
