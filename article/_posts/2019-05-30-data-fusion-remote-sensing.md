This paper brings together the advances of multisource and multitemporal data fusion approaches with different research communities and provides a thorough and discipline-specific starting point for researchers at different levels.
More specifically, it provides an overview of many important contributions dedicated to the topics of pansharpening and resolution enhancement, point cloud data fusion, hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion, multitemporal data fusion, as well as big data and social media.

The remote sensors onboard the multiples platforms may vary greatly in multiple dimensions.
For example, the types of properties sensed and the spatial and spectral resolutions of the data.

## Spatio-spectral fusion
*  Component Substitution
* Multiresolution Analysis
* Geostatistical Analysis
* Subspace Representation
* Sparse Representation

## Spatio-temporal fusion
* The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model(STARFM).
* For heterogeneous landscapes, an enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM).

## Point Cloud
* Point cloud level: Enrich the initial point cloud P with new point features.
* Image/Voxel level: Derive new image layers representing 3D point cloud information.
* Feature level: Fusion of point cloud information on the segment/object level.

## Conclusion
The field of multisensor and multitemporal data fusion for remotely sensed imagery is enormous.
This article focuses particularly on advances in multisource and multitemporal data fusion approaches with respect to different research communities since the methods for the fusion of different modalities have expand.
In fusion topics, including pansharpening and resolution enhancement, point cloud data fusion, hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion, multitemporal data fusion, as well as big data and social media.
