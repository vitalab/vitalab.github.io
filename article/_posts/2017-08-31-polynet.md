## Summary
Generalization of Inception-ResNet modules.  A PolyInception module is represented as a polynomial composition of Inception blocks, which may share parameters inside the same module.

## PolyInception modules

**Notation:**
- I is Input
- $$F, G, H$$ are inception "blocks"
- Same letter = Shared parameters


**Proposed modules:**
- poly-2: $$ I + F + F^2 $$
- mpoly-2: $$ I + F + GF $$
- 2-way: $$ I + F + G $$

**NOTE:** "mpoly-2" and "2-way" modules posess stronger expressive power but increase parameter size.


**Could go even further:**
- poly-3: $$ I + F + F^2 + F^3 $$
- mpoly-3: $$ I + F + GF + HGF $$
- 3-way: $$ I + F + G + H $$

## Inception-ResNet vs PolyNet structure

Inception-ResNet is composed of 3 "stages" (A-B-C) that operate on different spatial resolutions.

## Experiments and Results

**Dataset:** ILSVRC (ImageNet - 1000 classes)

Replacing Inception-ResNet-v2 stage B with PolyInceptions results in greater performance gains (compared to replacing the other 2 stages).

Using mixed PolyInception modules provides the best results.

PolyNet performance scales better with depth than ResNet/Inception-ResNet.

Performance gains over SotA are of the order of >1%.

## Conclusion

Take home message: Structural diversity is recommended when deepening a CNN.
