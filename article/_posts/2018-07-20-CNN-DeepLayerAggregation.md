## Introduction

![](/article/images/deepAggregation/sc01.png)

Simple paper which revisits the well-known dense connections and feature aggregations typical of architectures like DenseNet and PyramidNet.

## Method

They proposed two new architectures : one for classification (fig.3) and one for segmentation (fig.4)

Note that the segmentation architecture is like a U-Net but with conv layers between the encoding and decoding layers.  The number of conv layers is inversely proportionnal to the depth of the layers. 


## Results

Without much surprise, the proposed architectures got quite good results on a variety of classification datasets (like imagenet in Fig.5) and segmentation datasets (like Cityscapes in table 4).
