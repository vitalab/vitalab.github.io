# Highlights
The goal of the paper is to propose a method to reduce human effort while
maintaining the performance in interactive/weakly supervised segmentation
tasks. The goal is to create additional seed points and obtain accurate
segmentation results.

An automatic seed generation technique with deep reinforcement learning to
solve the interactive segmentation problem is proposed.

The contributions of the paper include:
1. The introduction of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for the
interactive segmentation task where an agent puts seeds on the image to improve
segmentation.
2. A novel reward function design to train the agent for automatic seed
generation with deep reinforcement learning.


# Summary
Provided that a point on the desired object and a point in the background are
given by the user, a sequence of artificial additional points are automatically
generated for precisely segmenting the desired object.

The problem is formulated as Markov Decision Process (MDP) and optimized by
reinforcement learning with Deep Q-Network (DQN).


# Introduction
Segmenting the object of interest in an image is one of the fundamental
problems in computer vision. However, without knowing the user's intention,
automatic object selection has inherent limitations because where and what
objects should be extracted differs by users.

The automatic seed generation problem is treated as a sequential
decision-making problem and train the seed generation agent with deep
reinforcement learning.

The advantage of the proposed system is that consistent performance has been
achieved in images in unobserved datasets as well as in previously observed
datasets.


# Methods
The agent starts by analyzing the image and the foreground/background
segmentation produced with the initial seeds by the user, and then determines a
new foreground or background seed. After creating a new segmentation by
combining the created seed with the initial seeds, the agent uses this
segmentation as a next input and repeats the process of creating seeds.

- **State/observation**: current binary segmentation for the next iteration.
- **Action**: positioning new seed point. The agent decides the label
(foreground/background) and position of the seed in the 2D grid given the
states. The action grid is low resolution.
- **Reward**: variation with the intersection-over-union (IoU) score between
the segmentation and ground truth based on regions.

The process is terminated after an arbitrary number of seeds have been
generated.

The method uses a Random Walk (RW) model to perform the segmentation operation
with the generated seeds.

The reward part is omitted during test time, and only the seed generation
process is performed.

# Results
Results on the variability with respect to the segmentation method are
included.

Training is performed on MSRA10K, results for unobserved datasets (GSCSEQ,
Weizmann Single Object, Weizmann Horse, iCoseg, IG02) are included.

# Discussion
Comparison to other approaches:
- Multiple instance learning (MIL): SeedNet requires no bounding box.
- Seeded region growing: SeedNet proposes new points rather than expanding the
seed area. Thus, chances for including other areas that are harder to reach for
a growing method are increased.

It can be considered as an alternative to the use of attention models and
reinforcement learning.

Only the binary mask information is added to the state to achieve robustness in
the segmentation with respect to the seeds.


# Conclusions
There are algorithms that allow to automatically select a point in the
foreground and the background, so adding such a method as a prior step would
ideally render the method fully automatic (if the seeds are acceptable).
