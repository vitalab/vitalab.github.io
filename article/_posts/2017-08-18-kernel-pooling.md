# Idea
  'Feature pooling' means encoding and aggregating feature maps to obtain higher-order and non linear feature interactions between features (ex : add $$ x_1x_2 $$ to $$ [x_1, x_2] $$ as a new feature), and 'kernel pooling' implies to learn from the data which feature kernels would be best by using a differentiable approximated representation to learn the kernels' parameters. It could be seen as an additional layer between convolutions (feature extraction) and linear layers (decision).
   
# Method
  Learn parameters of Taylor series kernels approximating gaussian RBF kernels
  
  The p-level tensor product is the pth order polynomial kernel and the Taylor series kernel is the sum of the polynomial kernel multiplied by factors from 1 up to p.
	Its standard form is hardly applicable due to memory limitations => compact form with Count Sketch kernel approximation (TensorSketch): unbiased approximation
	
p=4 is enough to approximate a gaussian kernel and other decomposable kernels could be approximated (especially by learning coefficients)

# Application
Tested on : ImageNet / CUB-200 / Stanford car set / FGComp2013 / Food101 
with : VGG-16 / ResNet-50
When compared to bilinear pooling and state-of-the-art, this shows an improvement of about 1-3% with both architectures

With VGG, 2nd and 3rd order feature interactions were weighted a lot more than with ResNet, which possibly shows that there is a better intrinsic capture information with ResNet large receptive field and residual modules.
