## Introduction
The segmentation method presented in this paper comes with 3 innovations:

1. Instead of an encoder-decoder architecture, they use **atrous** convolutions (or dilated conv) at the end of a VGG16 and a ResNet101 to **enlarge the spatial context**

2. To be more resilient to **multiresolution objects**, they use **atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)**

2. the use a **conditional random field (CRF)** at the CNN output to improve segmentation accuracy

# atrous conv

The **atrous** convolutions are convolutions with zeros in it.  This increases the receptive field without increasing the number of parameters

# ASSP

The **ASPP** is a parallel architecture which aggregate the feature maps obtained with atrous conv with various rate sizes a bit like an inception model.

# CRF

The **CRF** implements minimizes the following 2 equations

where $$p$$ stands for pixel position and $$I$$ for input image.  This function is minimized with an iterative message passing function.
