Paper:
- [code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResNeXt)
    
The main contribution of this paper is a new "cardinality" for the resnet block.

## Model

The difference between the resnet block and resnext block is really simple and well summarized in Figure 1.

They split the convolution in multiple parts (Figure 1 in 32 parts). They argue that the cardinality dimension controls the number of complex transformations and is more effective than width or depth dimension. Table 1 show side by side a resnet with a resnext with the same number of parameters and the same number of FLOPS.

where $$C$$ is the cardinality discussed before and it produces groups of convolutions as in Figure 1.

## Results

They report results on three and a half dataset Imagenet 1k, Cifar10, MSCOCO, and Imagenet 1k trained on Imagenet 5k
