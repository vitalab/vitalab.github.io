# Contribution

Observing that regular CNNs exhibit translational invariance but suffer from rotational variance, the authors
propose a CNN architecture based on steerable filters (called *SFCNN*) featuring rotation equivariance. Employing their approach
circumvents the need for rotation in data augmentation and reduces the '*sample complexity*' of the network.
The authors' main argument in support of equivariance properties of a network is that by doing so, the hypothesis
space (i.e. the possible transformations found in the data) is reduced which simplifies the learning task.

# Steerable Filters

 * A filter $$\Psi$$ is rotationally steerable if "*its rotation by an arbitrary angle $$\theta$$ can
   be expressed*" in terms of rotations applied to a set of atomic basis functions
   $$\{\psi_q\}^Q_{q=1}$$ resulting in
   
     $$\rho_\theta\Psi(x) = \sum^Q_{q=1} \kappa_q(\theta)\psi_q(x)$$.
     
 * The authors choose circular harmonics as the atomic basis functions:
     
     $$\psi_q \equiv \psi_{jk} = \tau_j(r) e^{\mathrm{i}k\phi}$$.
     
 * A specific learned filter is obtained by linear combination of these basis functions using weights
   $$w_{jk} \in \mathcal{C}$$ ($$\mathcal{C}$$ denotes the set of complex numbers) learned by the network:
     
     $$\tilde{\Psi}(x) = \sum^J_{j=1} \sum^{K_j}_{k=0} w_{jk}\psi_{jk}(x)$$.
 
   By choosing the learned weights to be complex, they induce rotations of the basis functions
   with respect to each other.


# Network architecture

 * Output features on intermediate layers are obtained by so-called **group convolutions** which are a natural
   extension of spatial convolutions to "*general transformation groups*". The group convolution is obtained
   by "*a spatial convolution, rotation and linear combination*" (denoted $$\mathcal{R}_\phi$$).

# Experiments

#### Rotated MNIST

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/article/images/SFCNN/angular_discretisation.png" width="700"></p>

 * **Left** - The test error saturates for more than 12 filter rotations. Also increasing the number of training
   samples improves performance as expected. The authors point out that an increase from 2 to 4 discrete filter rotations
   gives the same improvement as doubling the number of training samples. This supports their argument of
   a limited hypothesis space.
 * **Right** - Training on conventional MNIST, testing on samples rotated by the particular angle on the horizontal
   axis. SFCNN with 16 rotation angles.
   
    * **a**. Even with augmentation the CNNs do not achieve as good performance as SFCNNs.
    * **b**. Augmentation leads to decrease of performance even for testing on unrotated data sets for CNNs,
      but not for SFCNNs.
    * **c**. SFCNNs exhibit a better "*rotational generalisation*" than conventional CNNs.

 * The method outperforms the state of the art on the rotated MNIST data set. (Note: Especially, the proposed
   initialisation of the weights has an impact on performance.)


#### ISBI 2012 2D EM segmentation challenge

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/article/images/SFCNN/isbi2012.png" width="700"></p>

 * A SFCNN architecture with 17 rotation angles is used to segment images as the one on the left.
   Training data was augmented (among other transforms) by rotations of $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$.
 * The author's submission was rated by the challenge organisers and achieved top 3 performance based on the
   challenge metrics.
