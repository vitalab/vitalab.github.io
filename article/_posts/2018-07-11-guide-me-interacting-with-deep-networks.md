## Summary

A "guiding block" is added inside a CNN (at the "smallest" encoding layer) that uses text hints to modify feature maps in order to refine the CNN's prediction.

### Guiding block

In order to modify activation map $$ A \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C} $$, an RNN reads a sentence (parsed into a word embedding), and the last RNN state is fed to a dense layer that predicts: 
- Channel re-weighting vector $$ \gamma^{(s)} \in \mathbb{R}^C $$ and bias $$ \gamma^{(b)} \in \mathbb{R}^C $$
- Spatial re-weighting vectors $$ \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^H $$ and $$ \beta \in \mathbb{R}^W $$

Thus, a single element of the modified feature map is: $$ A^{\prime}_{h,w,c} = (1 + \alpha_h + \beta_w + \gamma^{(s)}_c) A_{h,w,c} + \gamma^{(b)}_c $$

This way, the number of parameters is much lower than a fully connected transformation. For example, for $$ 32 \times 32 \times 1024 $$ activation maps, instead of $$ \approx $$ 1 million parameters $$ ( H \times W \times C ) $$, only 1088 $$ ( H + W + C ) $$ are needed.


### Hint generation algorithm

An automatic _hint_ generation algorithm was developed to generate hints that are useful for the model.

Using the ground truth and the predicted segmentation, a "query" is created based on a few criteria such as missing semantic classes, noise in the prediction or wrongly predicted pixels that should be replaced. 

To do so, the image is divided in a coarse grid, and each cell is evaluated for missing or mistaken classes.
Then, a class is selected from the possible choices and a query is generated based on the position in the grid.

## Experiments

Various experiments were done on PascalVOC (2012) and MSCOCO-Stuff (2014), that evaluate where the guiding block should be placed, how many hints are needed, how complex should the hints be, etc.
