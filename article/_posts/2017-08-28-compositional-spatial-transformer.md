## Summary

The authors present a method to improve the robustness of a CNN to spatial variations. Instead of using a transformation nerwork [1] as in Fig.1 which tries to recover the warping function $$p$$ given the input image $$I_{in}$$, they implemented an iterative approach inspired by Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm.

The Lucas-Kanade algorithm tries to minimize the sum of squared differences
(SSD) objective $$ min_{\delta_p} ||I_{in}(p+\delta_p) - T(0)|| $$ where $$I_{in}$$ is the input image, $$p $$ is the transformation and $$T(0)$$ is a template image.  Since the Lucas-kanade algorithm is iterative ($$p=p+\delta_p$$), the proposed method implements a sequence of transformations networks.  So instead of trying to compute $$p$$ right away as for the STN, it computes a sequence of $$\delta_p$$.

The network in Fig.4 can be represented as a recurrent network

## Experiments and results

The authors show that the use of a recurrent transformation network gives better results while preventing from the boundary effect.
