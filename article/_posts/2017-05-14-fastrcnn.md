This is an effort to improve [R-CNN]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-04-18-rcnn.md %}).  Instead of feeding prospective bounding boxes to a CNN+SVM, the input image is fed to a VGG16 net.  At the **conv5** layer, each bounding box is used sequentially to crop the feature maps, followed by an **ROI Pooling** layer in order to resize the croped feature maps.  This is followed by the usual **FC layers + softmax**.  A bounding box regressor is also used to reposition the bounding boxes.

While results are slightly better than R-CNN on VOC 2017/10/12, Fast R-CNN is much faster both at train time and at test time.
