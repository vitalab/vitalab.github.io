## Summary

**SSD** is an adaptation of **YOLO** to support prior boxes. Prior boxes (called default boxes in the paper) are pre-calculated boxes with different aspect ratios and scales.
At prediction time, **SSD** predicts the correct prior box and the associated class. Also, SSD is using multiples feature maps to achieve a better performance.

##### Faster R-CNN works on any input size

## Model

The model is using the **VGG-16** model for its base. It then uses several feature maps to produce its output.

It's a more complex model than **YOLO** but it's faster because the input size is smaller.

Using [Atrous Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915) speeds up the model by 20%

### Default boxes

Default boxes are computed from the training sets, they are similar to the anchor boxes from Faster R-CNN. They help the network getting the right aspect-ratio.



## Loss

The loss function is similar to **YOLO**'s loss function. Instead of multiple detections per cell, it predicts a box per prior box. The loss is computed on the prior boxes with a Jaccard overlap bigger than 0.5. This allows multiple predictions per cell.
