# Highlights




The authors are working on data that has **different domain** and **different classes** and their goal is to disentangle the domain representation from the classes representation.  To do so, they built upon the paper [Learning Latent Subspaces in Variational Autoencoders](https://vitalab.github.io/article/2020/02/13/CSVAE.html).

# Methods


To do so, the authors learn 3 latent spaces (as opposed to 1 for a normal VAE) : 

* $$z_d$$ the *domain* latent space;
* $$z_x$$ the *data* latent space;
* $$z_y$$ the *class* latent space. 


Since the goal is to represent the joint distribution $$p(x,y,z_d,z_x,z_y)$$ and that the random variables are conditionally related, they provide in Figure 1 a graphical representation of the generative and inference models.

Since the exact inference of $$p(x\mid z_d,z_x,z_y)$$ is intractable, they use a variational inference framework (i.e. a VAE) with 3 separate encoders 

* $$q(z_d\mid x)$$;
* $$q(z_x\mid x)$$;
* $$q(z_y\mid x)$$;

that serve as variational posteriors. The resulting loss for the 3 subspace-VAE is as follows

where $$\beta$$ has the same disentangling purpose than for $$\beta-VAE$$.  Since the graphical model implies the learning of the following two functions

* $$q(d\mid z_d)$$;
* $$q(y\mid z_y)$$;

they do so via two adversarial neural networks.  As such, the resulting **Diva loss** is

# Results
They tested their method on the **rotated MNIST** dataset: a dataset which contains 6 rotated domains.  The visualization of the 3 latent spaces are shown in Figure 2.

The authors also report good classification accuracies compared to other domain adaptation methods:

The authors also compared against a single latent space with two adversarial neural networks as shown in Figure 8.   Results are reported in Table 10.
