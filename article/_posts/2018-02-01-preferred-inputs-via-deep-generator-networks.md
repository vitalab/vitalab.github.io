This paper introduces **DGN-AM**: Deep Generator Network for Activation Maximization.

# Training process

The training process involves **4 convolutional networks**:

1. $$ E $$, a fixed encoder network (the network being visualized)
2. $$ G $$, a generator network that should be able to recover the original image from the output of $$ E $$
3. $$ C $$, a fixed "comparator" network
4. $$ D $$, a discriminator

$$ G $$ is trained to invert a feature representation extracted by $$ E $$, and has to satisfy **3 objectives**:

1. For a feature vector $$ y = E(x) $$, the sythesized image $$ G(y) $$ has to be close to the original image $$ x $$
2. The features of the sythesized image $$ C(G(y)) $$ have to be close to those of the real image $$ C(x) $$
3. $$ D $$ should be unable to distinguish $$ G(y) $$ from real images (like a GAN)

**Architectures of the networks**:

* $$ E $$ is CaffeNet (pretty much AlexNet) truncated at a certain layer
* $$ C $$ is CaffeNet up to layer `pool5` (the last pooling layer before the first FC)
* $$ D $$ is a convolutional network with 5 conv + 2 FC
* $$ G $$ is an "upconvolutional" architecture with 9 upconv + 3 FC

# Choice of layer for representation

The best layer was determined empirically to be `fc6`.

# Applications

* Generate images that maximally activate a class neuron
* Generate images that maximally activate a hidden neuron
* Watch how features evolve during training
* "Produce creative, original art by synthesizing images that activate two neurons at the same time." (See images in section S8.)
