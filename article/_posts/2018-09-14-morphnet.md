### Introduction

![](/article/images/morphNet/sc01.jpg)

MorphNet is an approach to automate the design of neural network structures. MorphNet **iteratively shrinks and expands a network**, shrinking via a resource weighted 
sparsifying regularizer on activations and expanding via a uniform multiplicative factor on all layers.  The proposed method has 3 advantages :

* it is scalable to large models and large datasets; 
* it can optimize a DNN structure targeting a specific resource, such as FLOPs per inference, while allowing the usage of untargeted resources such as model size (number of parameters), to grow;
* it can learn a structure that improves performance while reducing the targeted resource usage

### Method

Let $$ O_L $$ be the output wight (number of output feature maps) or layer L and $$ O_{1:M} $$ the total number of feature maps between the first and last layer (M is the index of the last layer).  They formalized their problem as follows:

where the goal is to find the most accurate model (with the lowest loss) but which respect a limited resource.  For example here, the total number of flops must be below $$\zeta$$.  They then reformulate the problem as

where $$g(\theta)$$ is a sparsity regularizer which depends on $$ F(O_{1:M} )$$.  Since their method has no guarantee to satisfy $$F(O_{1:M})$$ < $$ \zeta $$, they proposed Algo 1 where step 1 and 2 are compression steps and step 3 is an expansion step.


### The regularizer

The regularizer is given by the following formula:

where

and $$f,g$$ is the spatial dimension of the filter at layer L and $$x,z $$ the spatial dimension of the feature maps of layer L.  Also, $$A_{L,i}$$ ($$B_{L,j}$$) is an indicator function which equals one
if the i-th input (j-th output) of layer L is alive – not zeroed out.


### Results

And ... the method works!
