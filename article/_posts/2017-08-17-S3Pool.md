# Idea
   New kind of pooling aiming to learn from the information that is discarded by classical pooling. The image is spatially partioned and the rows and columns of a pooling grid are non-uniformly and stochastically chosen without replacement. It acts as a strong regularizer equivalent to implicit data augmentation because the network will see a different distorsion of the feature maps at each pass.  
   
# Method
1. Partition the image $$ (h,w) $$ into strips of size $$ g $$ (both vertically and horizontally)
2. Randomly select $$ \frac{g}{s} $$ rows and columns from each strip to obtain the downsampling grid
-> The resulting feature map is of size $$ \frac{h}{s} $$, $$ \frac{w}{s} $$ (like a pooling with a window of size $$ s $$)
-> The pooling is likely to be non-uniform (different at each pass for the same image)
3. At test time, it is replaced either by standard max pooling or average pooling

# Application
Tested on CIFAR10-100 and STL-10 with ResNet 

This method performs better than dropout and classical stochastic pooling both with and without data augmentation.

The training time goes up by about 10-15%

Downsampling : regular and stochastic spatial with different grid sizes
