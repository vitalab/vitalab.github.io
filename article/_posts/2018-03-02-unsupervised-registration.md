The goal is to train a CNN for deformable, pairwise 3D medical image registration.

### Highlights

- Deformation function is learned over a dataset of images, instead of doing it for each image pairs (like ANTs).
- Atlas-based registration
- Loss function is a cross-correlation, easy to optimize on GPU
- Dice scores comparable to ANTs, but runs 130 times faster

**Typical images with ground truth segmentation**:

## Summary

- Input pair of images are already affinely aligned (only source of misalignment is nonlinear).

- U-Net model
- Input is 2 volumes concatenated as a 2-channel 3D image

**2 models**
- VoxelMorph-1: One less layer at the final resolution and fewer channels in the last 3 layers
- VoxelMorph-2: Full network

The deformed image is computed using a differentiable operation based on spatial transformer networks (subpixel locations + interpolation)

### Loss function

CC: Local cross-correlation (cross-correlation between images with local mean intensities subtracted out).

Regularization: L2 norm on the spatial gradients (approximated using differences between neighboring voxels). This enforces a spatially smooth deformation.


## Experiments

**Dataset**:
Multiple datasets are combined: ADNI, OASIS, ABIDE, ADHD200, MCIC, PPMI, HABS, Harvard GSP.
All scans are resampled to 256x256x256, 1mm isotropic.
FreeSurfer is used for affine spatial normalization and brain extraction, then images are cropped to 160x192x224.
Dataset sizes (train/valid/test): 7329 / 250 / 250.

An atlas is used as the fixed image for all image pairs.

Test set ground truth is provided by expert-labeled anatomical segmentations.

**Evaluation**: Dice score: volume overlap of anatomical segmentations. Include
any anatomical structures that are at least 100 voxels in volume for all test
subjects, resulting in 29 structures.

**Baseline**: Symmetric Normalization (ANTs)

**Implementation**: Tensorflow using Keras.
