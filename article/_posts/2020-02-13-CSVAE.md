# Highlights
- Novel Conditional Subspace VAE (CSVAE), that learns a low-dimensional latent subspace associated with each label
- The aim of the CSVAE model is twofold:
  - Learn higher-dimensional latent features correlated with binary labels in the data.
  - Represent these features using a subspace that is easy to interpret and manipulate when generating or modifying data.

# Introduction
The closest previous work that attempted to remove information correlated with the conditioned label is Conditional VAE
with Information Factorization (CondVAE-*info*), whose objective function is given below:

$$\max_\phi \min_\psi L(r_\psi(q_\phi(z \mid x)), y)$$

where $$r_{\psi}(z)$$ is an additional network trained to predict $$y$$ from $$z$$. However, the authors claim that the
fact that the decoder relies on the one-dimensional variable $$y$$ to reconstruct the data is suboptimal, hence the
motivation for the CSVAE.


# Methods
Suppose we are given a dataset $$D$$ of elements $$(x, y)$$ with $$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ and $$y \in Y = \{0, 1\}$$
representing $$k$$ features of $$x$$. Let $$H = Z \times W = Z \times \prod_{i=1}^{k} W_i$$ denote a probability space
which will be the latent space of our model. The goal of the CSVAE is to learn a latent representation of our data which
encodes all the information related to feature $$i$$ labelled by $$y_i$$ exactly in the subspace $$W_i$$.

The authors achieve this goal by maximizing a form of variational lower bound on the marginal log likelihood of the
model, along with minimizing the mutual information between $$Z$$ and $$Y$$. Just like in the CondVAE-*info*, minimizing
the mutual information is done with an adversarial network trying to predict $$Y$$ from $$Z$$.

The detailed explanation of the objective functions is quite long, and should be read in the full paper. To better
understand the role of each variable (and the notation used later on) suffice to say that this is how the authors
decompose the joint-likelihood:

$$ \log p_{\theta,\gamma}(x,y,w,z) = \log p_\theta(x \mid w,z) + \log p(z) + \log p_\gamma(w \mid y) + \log p(y)$$

An example of what the method can achieve on the swiss roll is shown in Figure 2.

### Encoding in subspaces
To project the data in the latent subspaces, the authors seem to use a distinct encoder for each subspace, meaning
distinct encoders for each:
- label, in case of binary label, or
- label value, in case of multi-label that should be one-hot encoded (like the TFD referenced later).

For arbitrary fixed choices $$\mu_1,\sigma_1,\mu_2,\sigma_2$$, for each $$i=1,\dots,k$$ the authors state:

$$ p(w_i \mid y_i=1) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$$
$$ p(w_i \mid y_i=0) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$$

The authors also mention that they always chose $$W_i=\mathbb{R}_2$$ for all $$i$$. The choice is arbitrary, but it
helps when visualizing the distribution of the data in the latent subspace.

### Attribute manipulation
The authors define an attribute switching function $$G_{i,j}$$ to change the label of $$x \in X$$ from $$i$$ to $$j$$.

As reference, we could define $$G_{i,j}$$ in the following manner for a traditional VAE:

For each $$i = 1,\dots,k$$ let $$S_i$$ be the set of $$(x,y) \in D$$ with $$y_i=1$$. Let $$m_i$$ be the mean of the
elements of $$S_i$$ encoded in the latent space, that is $$\mathbb{E}_{S_i}[\mu_\phi(x)]$$. We can define:

$$G_{i,j}(x) = \mu_\theta(\mu_\phi(x) - m_i + m_j)$$

For the CSVAE, the definition of $$G_{i,j}$$ is now as follows:

Let $$p = (p_1, \dots, p_k) \in \prod_{i=1}^k W_i$$ be any vector with $$p_l = \vec{0}$$ for $$l \not= j$$.
For $$(x,y) \in D$$ we can define:

$$G_{i,j}(x,p) = \mu_\theta(\mu_{\phi_1}(x), p)$$


## Data
As for real experiments, the model was tested on two different faces datasets. First, the Toronto Faces Dataset,
consisting of approximately 120,000 grayscale face images partially labelled with expressions and identity. Second, the
CelebA dataset of approximately 200,000 images of celebrity faces with 40 labelled attributes. In the latter case, the
authors filtered the data into two separate datasets which focus on a particular attribute of interest.
