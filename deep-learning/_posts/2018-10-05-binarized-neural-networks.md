## Summary

> BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets
> We wrote a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy.

Goal : 

- Binarize weights and activations
- Be more efficient: 
	> most of the 32-bit floating point multiply-accumulations are replaced by 1-bit XNOR-count operations
- Use less memory: 
	> In comparison with 32-bit DNNs, BNNs require 32 times smaller memory size and 32 times fewer memory accesses


### Deterministic vs. stochastic binarization

**Deterministic** : 

$$ x^b = \text{sign}(x) = \begin{cases} +1 \text{ if } x >= 0, \\ -1 \text{ otherwise} \end{cases} $$

**Stochastic** : 

$$ x^b =  \begin{cases} +1 \text{ with probability } p = \sigma(x), \\ -1 \text{ with probability } 1 - p \end{cases}; $$

$$ \text{ where } \sigma(x) = \text{clip}(\frac{x+1}{2}, 0, 1) = \max(0, \min(1, \frac{x+1}{2})) $$

- Note: Stochastic binarization should be better than deterministic binarization, but is harder to implement since it requires random bits.


### Training and gradients

- Real-valued gradients of the weights and activations are stored during training for SGD to work.

- The derivative of the sign function is zero almost everywhere, so the gradient cannot be used as is.
Instead, a straight-through estimator is used, which corresponds to computing the gradient of the _hard tanh_: $$ \text{Htanh}(x) = \text{clip}(x, -1, 1) $$

- For better efficiency, Shift-based BatchNorm is used, which is an approximation of BatchNorm that uses almost no multiplications.
