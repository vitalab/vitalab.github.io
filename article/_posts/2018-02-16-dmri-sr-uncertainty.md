## Bayesian Image Quality Transfer (IQT) with CNNs

The goal is to upsample low-resolution (LR) dMRI images to high resolution (HR) and measure uncertainty in the prediction.

### Highlights

- Previous models were limited to 2D images, but the proposed model works on 3D volumes and outperforms others in accuracy and speed (whole-brain DTI SR in 1s).

- Ability to estimate uncertainty in the SR mapping. 


## Summary

### Model

The super-resolution (SR) task is a patch-wise regression from LR to HR. The authors use a baseline 2D CNN (Efficient subpixel-shifted convolutional network, CVPR 2016) and extend it to 3D volumes (3D-ESPCN).

NOTE: Instead of upsampling a LR image and refining it thorugh the CNN, the LR image is directly processed and the last feature maps are combined to produce a HR image (*learned interpolation*).

**Computational cost is reduced and there no loss of information from upsampling the LR image before processing**

A receptive field of 5x5x5 is used to predict 1x1x1 feature maps (resulting in a 2x2x2 HR patch in the final image after shuffling).

The network is *in theory* trained using L2 reconstruction.


### Uncertainty estimation

The authors address 2 types of uncertainty:
- Intrinsic uncertainty (variance of the statistical mapping from LR to HR, aka one-to-many problem; independent of the amount of training data)
- Parameter uncertainty (ambiguity in model parameters)


**Intrinsic uncertainty**

Minimizing a mean squared error is equivalent to minimising the NLL under a Gaussian noise model:

In this case, the variance is fixed and represents the *intrinsic uncertainty* in the mapping. In practice however, uncertainty is not constant across all spatial locations and image channels. The authors address this issue by using a heteroscedastic noise model to estimate the variation across the image. The likelihood becomes:

Here, the mean and variance are estimated by two different 3D-ESPCN models:

**Parameter uncertainty**

Instead of relying in a single estimate of the network parameters, the authors propose to limit overfitting using a bayesian approach with Variational Dropout. In summary, Gaussian noise is injected in the network weights during training, but the amount of noise is learned.



## Experiments

**Super resolution**
- Human Connectome project (multiple sets of 8 subjects, HR + downsampled LR)
- Lifespan dataset (different acquisition than HCP, lower resolution, different age range)

**Tractography with SR**
- Prisma dataset (3T scanner, similar to HCP)
