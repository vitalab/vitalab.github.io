VERY extensive survey of more than 300 deep learning methods applied to medical image analysis.  It includes all kinds of neural networks including autoencoders, RBM, DBM, and most importantly CNN, as well as different modalities (MRI. CTscan, echo, etc.) and applications (cardiac, brain, oncology, etc.).
