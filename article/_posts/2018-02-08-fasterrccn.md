This is an effort to improve [R-CNN]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-04-18-rcnn.md %}) and [Fast-CNN]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-05-14-fastrcnn.md %}). 
The main improvements are : 

* The author uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that proposes boxes out of a given feature map which allows end-to-end training (previous methods used a third party proposal method).

* They use multi-resolution anchor boxes

## Conv layers
They use **VGG-16** and the feature maps fed to the RPN are those in **layer 5**.

## Region Proposal Network
The RPN shares the same features maps than the Faster RCNN network to allow end-to-end training.  To generate region proposals, they slide a small network over the convolutional feature map returned by the last shared convolutional layer (in their implementation, layer 5 of VGG-16). This small network takes as input an $$n\times n$$ spatial window of the input convolutional feature map and output a **box-regression layer** (reg) and a **box-classification layer** (cls) (c.f.Figure 3).  This architecture is implemented with an $$n\times n$$ convolutional layer followed by two sibling $1 \times 1$ convolutional layers

## Loss function
The loss function is the sum of a cross-entropy for the labels and a regression loss between the predicted bounding box and the groundtruth boxes (1 box = 4 coordinates).

## Results
FasterRNN gets respectively a mean AveragePrecision (mAP) of 78.8 and 75.9 on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.
