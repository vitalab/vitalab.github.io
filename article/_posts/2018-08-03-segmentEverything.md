### Description

Most methods for object instance segmentation require all training examples to be labeled with segmentation masks. This requirement makes it expensive to annotate new
categories and has restricted instance segmentation models
to well-annotated classes. The goal of this paper is to propose a **new partially supervised training paradigm**, together with a novel weight transfer function, that enables
training **instance segmentation models** on a large set of categories
all of which have box annotations, but **only a small
fraction of which have mask annotations**. These contributions
allow to train [Mask R-CNN](https://vitalab.github.io/article/2017/09/14/MaskRcnn.html) to detect and segment visual concepts using box annotations  and mask annotations.

### Proposed method

 The idea is that instead of learning the Mask R-CNN bounding box head and mask head 
 independently, they use the **bounding box head to predict the mask head parameters** using a
 generic, category-agnostic weight transfer function that can
 be jointly trained as part of the whole model.

In other words, instead of learning the segmentation weights $$w^c_{seg}$$ directly as usual, they learn it via a transfer function $T(.)$ :

$$ w^c_{seg} = T(w^c_{det},\theta)$$

where $$w^c_{det}$$ are the bounding box head weights.  In their implementation, $$T(.)$$ is a fully connected neural net.  C.f. Fig.2 for more details.

### Results

They get good results, at least better than by training Mask R-CNN with GrabCut.
