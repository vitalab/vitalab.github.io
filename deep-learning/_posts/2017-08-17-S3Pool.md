# Idea
   New kind of pooling aiming to learn from the information that is disgarded by classical pooling. The image is spatially partioned and the rows and columns of a pooling grid are non-uniformly and stochastically chosen. It acts as a strong regularizer eauivalent to implicit data augmentation because the network will see a different distorsion of the features maps at each pass.  
   
# method
1. Partitioning of the image (h,w) into strips of  size g (both vertically and horizontally)
2. Randomly select s rows and columns from each strips to obtain the downsampling grid
→ the resulting feature map is of siwe h/s, g/s (like a pooling with a window of size s)
→ the pooling is likely to be non-uniform (different at each pass for the same image)
3. At test time, it is replaced either by standard max pooling or average pooling

# Application
Tested on : CIFAR10-100 and STL-10
With : ResNet 

This method performs better than dropout and classical stochastic pooling both with and without data augmentation.

! The training time goes up by about 10-15% !
