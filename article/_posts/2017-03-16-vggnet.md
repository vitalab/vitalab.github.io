Winner of the 2014 edition of the ImageNet classification challenge (ILSVRC-2014).  The authors proposed 6 networks similar but deeper than the [AlexNet](https://vitalab.github.io/article/2017/03/01/alexnet.html) configuration.  They show that the 16-layer and the 19-layer models and the best ones. The main novelty with this paper is the use of small 3x3 filters in a deeper architecture.
