This paper presents a novel statistical distribution: a **CON**tinuous relaxation of a dis**CRETE** distribution. Contrary to discrete random variables, the _Concrete_ random variables are suited for use in stochastic computation graphs trained with automatic differentiation.

This is useful for learning the shape of a discrete distribution. The binary case is the _Binary Concrete_, and is useful, among other things, for pruning a neural network[^1].

# Discrete Random Variables in a computation graph

Consider $$\mathrm{Discrete}(\alpha)$$, a discrete distribution with unnormalized parameters $$\alpha_k \in (0,\infty)$$, where the probability of outcome $$k$$ is $$\alpha_k / \sum_i \alpha_i$$. The sampling from this distribution can be formulated with the Gumbel-Max trick, as seen in Figure&nbsp;1(a). Note that the discrete values are encoded in a **one-hot vector**, and that $$G_i$$ are samples from the standard Gumbel distribution.

Note that instead of optimizing $$\alpha$$ directly, we would optimize $$\log \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$. This allows to avoid constraining the parameters of the network.

Sampling from the standard Gumbel can be done using $$f(U)=-\log(-\log U)$$ with $$U \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)$$.

# Concrete Random Variables

**The derivative of the argmax is 0 everywhere except at the boundary of state changes, where it is undefined.** For this reason the Gumbel-Max trick is not a suitable reparameterization for use in stochastic computation graphs trained with automatic differentiation. This is why the Concrete distribution is introduced; see Figure&nbsp;1(b) for how to sample from it. Basically, **the argmax operation is replaced with a softmax**.

**This allows to optimize $$\alpha_k$$ via gradients, and thus learn the shape of the distribution.**

The parameter $$\lambda$$ acts as a temperature parameter for the softmax; it controls the relaxation. When $$\lambda \to 0$$, the softmax becomes an argmax.

# The Binary Special Case

Suppose that you want to learn the value of a binary variable, such as the elements of a binary mask. For example, you could want to mask feature maps in a network and find which features to keep or discard.

While a one-hot vector is the standard way of encoding a discrete variable with more than two values, **for a binary variable we only need a binary scalar**.

Sampling from the Binary Concrete can be done using $$f(U)=\mathrm{Sigmoid}(( \log \alpha + L(U) ) / \lambda)$$, where $$L(U)=\log U - \log(1-U),\ U \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)$$ samples from the Logistic distribution. Notice how similar this is to the non-binary case; instead of Gumbel samples, we use Logistic samples, and instead of a Softmax, we use a Sigmoid, but the rest is identical.

## Implementation notes

* Optimize $$\log \alpha$$ instead of $$\alpha$$. I suggest naming your optimized tensor `log_alpha`.
* Initialize $$\log \alpha$$ values around zero. The zero-centered normal with scale $$0.01$$ should work.
* Try $$\lambda=2/3$$ (see paper for details).

# Notes

[^1]: Actually, the "Hard Concrete", a twist on the Binary Concrete, is even better for pruning. See the review on "Structured Pruning of Neural Networks with Budget-Aware Regularization" for details.
