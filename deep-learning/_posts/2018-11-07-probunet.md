This model outputs the segmentation map along with a confidence for each pixel. To do this, they use variational inference and sample multiple time to create multiple proposals. Those proposals are then combined to output the confidence.

As we see in fig. 1, they do use a different architecture during training time. They train a variational encoder using the groundtruth and another encoder which only uses the input. The loss then combines the agreement between both variational encoders and the standard cross-entropy.

An interesting figure is that the more predictions you make, the energy between prediction goes down quickly.

Their model is also better at finding ambigous regions (73% vs 70% accuracy).
