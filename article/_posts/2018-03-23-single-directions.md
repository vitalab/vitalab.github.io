**Is a _cat neuron_ a good thing?** A paper from Deep Mind that explores the relationship between _class selectivity_ and generalization.

In a layer that has high _class selectivity_, a neuron will fire up for a class while other neurons are off. The activation vector is thus pointing in a _single direction_. In networks that rely on single directions, random ablation of neurons will greatly affect the network's output. Thus, the authors use random ablation as their experimentation method for testing their hypotheses.

# Generalization and single directions

* Networks that rely more on single directions tend to have lower generalization capability
* Introducing noise in labels forces the network to memorize

# Single directions for model selection

* Single direction reliance is a good indicator of generalization
* Could be used instead of a validation/test set

# Dropout and BatchNorm

* BatchNorm discourages reliance on single directions
* Dropout does not help beyond the dropout proportion used while training

# Does class selectivity make a good neuron?

* Class selectivity of single directions is uncorrelated to their importance to the network's output
* We should not analyse DNNs by looking for _cat neurons_ or other class selective neurons
