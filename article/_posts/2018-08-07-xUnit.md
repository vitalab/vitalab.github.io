# Main idea

The authors observe that commonly used activation functions are

 * **a.** not learnable
 * **b.** do not regard spatial relationships.

Hypothesising that a more sophisticated activation function addressing
observations **a.** and **b.** could enable a CNN to make more efficient
use of its parameters, they show how using their proposed activation
function, called *xUnit*,

 * **1.** leads to reduced number of overall network parameters (less network depth)
 * **2.** optimises the ratio of parameters used for convolution and
          activation.

# A new learnable spatial activation function: xUnit

As shown in the figure below, the activation function can be interpreted
as a transform of the input signal $$z_k$$ resulting in a scalar output
which is then multiplied with $$z_k$$ to obtain the layer output
$$x_{k+1}$$. The idea of *xUnit* is to use a transform which is
learnable and which

 * introduces a non-linearity (ReLU)
 * regards spatial context (convolution)
 * features gating map in $$[0,1]$$ (gaussian).

# Experiments

Since the *xUnit* is introducing a significant amount of additional
parameters the main question is if the use of this activation function
improves the tradeoff between number of network parameters and
network performance.

#### Choice of xUnit hyperparams

The figure below shows the comparison of a CNN architecture consisting
of *'Conv-BN-ReLU'* layers with its *xUnit*-augmented version in which
layers are discarded to match the same number of parameters, on a
denoising task (BSD dataset, 400 images).
All *xUnit* configurations outperform the basic CNN network.

The authors find a convolution filter size of $$9\times9$$ in the
*xUnits* to be optimal.

Comparing the activation maps in a specific layer, it becomes apparent
that the *xUnit* results in more dense activations and thus more
feature maps contribute to the final result, as compared to the basic
CNN approach where activations are sparse and mostly binary.

#### Image denoising

The authors create their experiment dataset by adding gaussian noise
to the images of the *Berkely segmentation dataset* (BSD, 400 images).
They compare the performance to state of the art (non-NN) methods as
well as the *DnCNN* (Denoise CNN). The latter serves as a basis for
modification with their *xUnit* activation function and subsequent
drop of network layers.

As can be seen in the table below, state of the art performance is
achieved while significantly reducing the number of network parameters.

Investigating the obtained image results, the output of their method
seems to be slightly more appealing which might be due to the reported
difference in activation maps (see above) potentially allowing for more
complex aggregations of the feature maps.

#### Other experiments

In the same spirit as the denoising experiment, they show the efficiency
of their proposal in the tasks of 'de-raining' as well as
'super resolution'. Check the paper for more details.
