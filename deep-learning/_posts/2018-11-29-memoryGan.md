## Introduction


The authors of the paper propose a novel way to counter catastrophic forgetting during sequential learning 
of GANs. They propose _Memory Replay GANs_ (MeRGANs), a conditional GAN that integrates memory replay. 


## Sequential learning 

The task proposed by the authors is to sequentially learn from a training set $$S = \{ S_1, ..., S_M\} $$ 
where M is the number of categories. Each subset $$S_C$$ represents the training set for a specific category 
and is considered a task t. The goal is to train a conditional GAN to generate images from all
the sets after being trained on each set sequentially.


**All methods use an AC-GAN framework with the WGAN-GP loss.**

The generator's parameters are denoted $$\theta^G$$. The generator generates images according to
$$ \tilde{x} = G_{\theta^G}(z, c)$$ where z is a latent vector and c is a category. 

The discriminator's parameters are denoted $$\theta^D$$. 

The AC-GAN uses a auxiliary classifier C whose parameters are denotes $$\theta^C$$. The classifier predicts
 the image labels $$ \tilde{c} = C_{\theta^C}(x)$$

The GAN's parameters are denoted as $$\theta = (\theta^G, \theta^D, \theta^C)$$ in the equations. 


## Previous Methods

__Joint learning__

This method is not sequential learning, all categories are learned at the same time. The classical GAN 
optimization is used with 
WGAN modifications.

where $$L^G_{GAN}(\theta, s)$$ and $$\lambda_{CLS}L^G_{CLS}(\theta, s)$$ are GAN loss and cross-entropy 
loss. $$y_c$$ is the one-hot encoding for the category c. 

The category c is sampled uniformly and z is sampled from a Gaussian distribution. 

The discriminator is trained according to the following equations:

__Sequential fine tuning__ 

The authors define a sequence of T tasks, one for each category. They then train their GAN one task at a 
time. Each GAN is initialized with the previous GAN's parameters.

__Elastic Weight Consolidation__

The authors present Elastic Weight Consolidation as a baseline for their new method to prevent forgetting. 
Elastic Weight Consolidation involves adding regularization to prevent the GAN's parameters from changing 
too much during each task.

$$F_{t-1,i}$$ is the Fisher information matrix that indicates how sensitive the parameter $$\theta^G_{t,
i}$$ is to forgeting.  


## Method

__Joint retraining with replayed samples__

Their first method involves extending the current task's dataset with the memory from the previous task's 
GAN. $$ S_t' = S_c \cup_{c\in{1,...,t-1}} \tilde{S_c}$$, where $$\tilde{S_c}$$ is the replay set generated by
$$\tilde{x} = G_{\theta^G_{t-1}}(z, c)$$.

__Replay alignment__

The second method the authors propose involves adding a loss term for the generator. This loss term is an 
L2 loss between the current and previous GAN outputs for the same category c and latent vector z.

## Results

The authors tested their two MeRGANs on digits generation with Mnist and SVHN and scene generation with 4 
classes from the LSUN dataset. They compared their results to joint training, sequential fine tuning, 
Elastic Weight Consolidation and deep generative replay (Unconditional GAN with replay memory).

The authors trained a classifier on real data and used the classification accuracy 
on the generated data to evaluate forgetting.

The authors used a classifier to evaluate forgetting. They tested a classifier trained on real data on generated data and a classifier trained on generated data on real data 
(Rev acc.). Finally, they tested the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) on the generated data.
