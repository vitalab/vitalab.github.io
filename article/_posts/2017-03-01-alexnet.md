Super famous 2012 AlexNet paper which presented the first CNN model applied to ImageNet.  The networks comes with:

* 5 conv layers with maxpooling and ReLU;
* 2 FC layers + softmax of 1000 classes;
* Multi-GPU
* Local response normalization ("This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels.")
* Overlapping pooling
* Data augmentation
* Dropout
