### Summary

Image-to-Image (or Pix-2-Pix) is a type of conditionnal GAN that does not use noise to generate its output. Instead, it uses a label map as an input to the generator. The discriminator receives the label map and the generated image to makes its decision.

### Generator
The generator is basically an [U-Net](/deep-learning/2017/02/27/unet.html) which takes the label map as the input and produces an image.

### Discriminator
The discriminator is a normal CNN with a sigmoid activation layer at the end. It also uses LeakyReLU for every convolutionnal layer. The input of the discriminator is both the label map and the generated image.

### Loss
Pix-2-Pix is using the standard conditional GAN loss plus a regularization term L1.

Where lambda is a hyper-parameter (100 is suggested).
