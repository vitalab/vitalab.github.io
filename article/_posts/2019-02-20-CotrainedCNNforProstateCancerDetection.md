## Summary

This paper presents an automated Prostate cancer (mentionned as PCa) detection system which can concurrently identify the presence of PCa in an image and localize lesions based on co-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) features and a single-stage SVM classifier. Each network is trained using images of a single modality (ADC or T2w) in a weakly-supervised manner (labels only indicate the presence of PCa without lesions' locations).


## Method

> ![](/article/images/Co-trainedCNNforProstateCancerDetection/Fig1_Yang2017.png)

**1. Image registration**
ADC and T2w images are aligned (ADC on the reference T2w). Method Free Form Model based on mutual information maximization

**2. Automatic detection of prostate region**
The detection is done with a simple regression CNN network. Image is then cropped and intensities normalized  

**3. Co-Trained CNN for Cancer Response Map generation**
Each pair of aligned ADC and T2w is input in the CNN (architecture similar to GoogleNet)-> output cancer response map and a 1024 feature vector (1024 ADC + 1024 T2w are then concatenated). Cancer response map then converted into a scalar p = projected gap score = likelihood wether a 2D MRI slice contains PCa or not.  

**4. Post processing for PCa localization**
Concatenated 2048 feature vector of each slice is input into a RBF-SVM classifier (better results than softmax). Ouput probability of containing PCa -> perform processing on ADC CRMs of the selected slices.\\
Non-maximum suppression on _M_ADC_  to detect local maximum points as the candidates. Candidates with response values above a threshold (based on Otsu's algorithm) are kept.

**Loss**

They define a error E which is a weighted sum of 3 losses :

_l(p,y)_ are cross entropy losses and _l(M_ADC, M_T2w)_ is defined as :

They chose w1 = w2 = 1 and w3 = 0.2 (selected empirically).

## Contributions
1st work of PCa detection which performs multimodal fusion by co-training CNN features for both modalities, where the information of each modality is employed to guide the CNN feature learning of the other modality.



## Experiments

- 160 patients : 72 Pca and 88 BPH (PCa free)
- images acquired on a 3T MRI
- data augmentation : non-rigid deformation
- reference : 2 experts manually outlined the region of interest for each positive patient on 5 T2w slices -> intersection of the 2 delineations
- evaluation metrics : FROC curve for overall performance, ROC for binary task PCa vs lesion-free images, LLF and NL for localization performance

**Pre-trained CNN vs training from scratch**

**6 variants of the method to distinguish PCa vs lesion-free images**

**PCa localization**
> ![](/article/images/Co-trainedCNNforProstateCancerDetection/Table2_Yang2017.png)

LLF = Lesion Localization Fraction : total nb of detected point within a real lesion / total nb of true lesions (true positive)\\
NL = Non-Lesion Localization (false positive)

Dice DSC = 0.66, which is not the best but they argue that their method requires less manual annotation effort.

**Overall performance**
> ![](/article/images/Co-trainedCNNforProstateCancerDetection/Fig11_Yang2017.png)

AUC 0.97, 0.96, 0.96, 0.96, 0.95 for 1, 2, 4, 8 and all images per normal patient data.

**Confusion matrix for GS grading**\\
Preliminary evaluation based on 25 training samples. 5 lesions per category for training and 5 lesions for testing. 5 slices 2D per lesions.

## Conclusion
- Feasible to learn lesion localization with weakly-supervised CNN
- Benefit of incorporating information of one modality into the feature learning process of the other
