## Introduction

They propose a generic and novel technique to incorporate priors on shape and label structure into NNs for cardiac image analysis tasks.  For this, they constrain the training process and guide the NN to make anatomically
more anatomically meaningful predictions.  For this, they use a convolutional autoencoder network
to learn anatomical shape variations from medical images.

They show that their method works both on MRI and Ultrasound images and can be used for segmenation and super resolution purposes.

where $$x$$ is the input image, $$y$$ the label field, $$f(y)$$ is the autoencoder code for $$y$$, $$L_x(...) is the usual cross-entropy$$ and $$L_he$$ is the l2 distance between autoencoder codes:
