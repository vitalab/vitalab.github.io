Metropolis-Hastings GAN (MH-GAN) modifies the way we do inference on the generator at test time. While common GAN architectures simple draw from the generator randomly, MH-GAN uses a Metropolis-Hastings scheme to select the best sample possible. This scheme belongs to the wide family of MCMC methods where you draw a chain of samples. A new sample $$x'$$ is accepted over the current sample $$x$$ with probability $$\alpha$$:

$$ \alpha(x', x) = min(1, \frac{D(x)^{-1} - 1}{D(x')^{-1} - 1}) $$
$$D(x) = \frac{p_D(x)}{p_D(x) + p_G(x)}$$

where $$p_D$$ is the data density and $$p_G$$ is the density of samples from G.
In practice, this score is given by the discriminator.

They also *calibrate* their network because the score given by the discriminator is often not reliable and cannot be treated as probabilities. Using an held-out set, they warp the output of the discriminator.

The method seems to help with the common **mode collapse** issue and can be used with any GAN architecture (DRS is a naive discriminator rejection sampling).

They do get better Inception scores :
