# Implicit neural networks

Implicit neural representations (INRs) are a class of neural networks that represent a function instead of solving a task. Their main advantage is that they can represent signals continuously in space, which is useful for tasks such as 3D reconstruction, image generation, and physical simulation. This tutorial will introduce the concept of INRs with a focus on medical imaging applications.

See [Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/vitalab/vitalab.github.io/tree/master/tutorial/documents/INR_tutorial.ipynb) for some implementation examples.
