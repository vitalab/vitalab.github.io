This paper implements all the well-known advances in deep learning segmentation methods and make it work together on the [CamVid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/){:target="_blank"} and [Gatech](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/videogeometriccontext/){:target="_blank"} datasets.

The proposed network implements the following things:

* Dense blocks
* U-Net architecture

## Dense blocks

The dense block provides a low increase of parameters while keeping a good feature extraction.

## U-Net

The [U-Net]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /article/2017-02-27-unet %}) is well-known to have a good performance on various image segmentation datasets.

## Architecture

The network architecture is a straight U-Net with more convolution stages in each step.

In the following table, $$m$$ represents the number of feature maps output, DB means dense block, TD means transition down and TU means transition up.

### Layers

Here is the internal description of all the blocks defined above.

## Results

Overall the model is as accurate than the other state-of-the-art models while having much fewer parameters (100x less for some of them).

### Issues

Even if the model has fewer parameters than the others models, you should keep in mind that it still has far more layers than a regular U-Net so the memory footprint is huge when you want to train it.

If you run it on theano you should use some `THEANO_FLAGS` like `optimizer_including=fusion` to decrease the memory footprint and use a smaller batch_size.

#### Implementations

This original `Theano/Lasagne` implementations of the paper can be found here [FC-DenseNet](https://github.com/SimJeg/FC-DenseNet/){:target="_blank"}.

This is my personal `Keras/notebook` contribution [implementation](https://gist.github.com/czotti/b1e34c23a92e64490be83f3b8908bdbe){:target="_blank"}.
