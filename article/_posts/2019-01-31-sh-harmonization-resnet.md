## Summary

**Goal**: Harmonize the dMRI signal differences between scanners

**Method**: Use a ResNet on 3x3x3 patches to harmonize SH coefficients voxel-wise, by learning a mapping between sites.

**Highlights**:
- No need for registration (at test time)
- Model-free (spherical harmonics do not impose a model on the data)


## Model

> ![](/article/images/sh-harmonization-resnet/figure1.png)

- RISH projection: At test time, RISH features are used to project the harmonized signal and correct for changes in fiber orientation

> ![](/article/images/sh-harmonization-resnet/equation1.png)

where $$S_i'$$ are the hamonized SH coefficients and $$S_i$$ the non-harmonized SH coefficients of order $$i$$.

Reminder:
> RISH: Squared L2 norm for each order of SH coefficients




## Results

**Datasets**: 

CDMRI harmonization Challenge
- 10 healthy subjects, scanned on a 3T GE Excite-HD and a 3T Siemens Prisma, with 30 directions at b=1200.

**Training**:
- FAST registration for training subjects
- 5 epochs using Adam with batch size 256, then SGD with batch size 128 and learning rate decay...


**Experiments**:
- Investigate the sensitivity of the method to the number of ResBlocks _n_ (Table 1)
- Evaluate the ability to reduce inter-scanner variance in the signal itself and metrics like FA/MD (Figures 2,3,4)
- 10-fold cross-validation using the 10 subjects (8 training, 1 validation, 1 test).

The only reported baseline is the Golkov method[^1], a 3-layer, 150 units neural network with ReLU and Dropout designed, applied on a single voxel at a time; it was "designed" for the estimation of scalar measures from diffusion data, and seems completely unrelated to harmonization.

**There is no classical method baseline...**
