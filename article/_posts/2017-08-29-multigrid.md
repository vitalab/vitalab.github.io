This paper presents a new way of using convolutions. They test their models for three different tasks namely, classification, semantic segmentation, and spatial transformation.

Rather than using a convolution on only one scale, they use multiple convolutions at each scale of the input. Each of these scales also contains information from the scales close to it.

## Results

For the classification, they use CIFAR-100 dataset, for semantic segmentation they build a synthetic dataset based on MNIST, and for the spatial transformation they use the same synthetic dataset.
