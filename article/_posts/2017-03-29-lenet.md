LeNet is often cited as the earliest convolutional neural network with a similar architecture to what we see today. It is also one of the first applications of convolutional layers in neural networks. It follows work from LeCun et al. (1989), where the advantages of spatially-invariant feature maps were described.

See [Yann LeCun's page about LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) for demos and other info.
