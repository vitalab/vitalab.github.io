A neural net for classification and segmentation of point clouds.

# The PointNet Architecture

![](/article/images/pointnet/pointnet.jpg)

* Sequence of point-wise MLPs
* Sub-networks for data-dependent transforms (T-Net)
* Max-pooling at the end for a global feature vector
* Concatenate local feat-vect with global feat-vect for segmentation

## Pros

* Learns to summarize a shape by a sparse set of key points
* Robust to missing points
* No voxelization, no rasterization, no convolution
* End-to-end learning (no hand-crafted features)
* Supports N-dimensional points (e.g. spatial + color)
* Low-complexity

## Cons

* Slightly worse than "Multi-view CNN" (which generates 2D projections of the point cloud)

# Results

## Qualitative results

**Part Segmentation Results**. We visualize the CAD part segmentation results across all 16 object categories. We show both results for partial simulated Kinect scans (left block) and complete ShapeNet CAD models (right block).

**Semantic Segmentation Results**. Top row is input point cloud with color. Bottom row is output semantic segmentation result (on points) displayed in the same camera viewpoint as input.

**Visualizing Critical Points and Shape Upper-bound**. The first row shows the input point clouds. The second row shows the critical points picked by our PointNet. The third row shows the upper-bound shape for the input -- any input point sets that falls between the critical point set and the upper-bound set will result in the same classification result.
