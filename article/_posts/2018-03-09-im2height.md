### Description
The goal of that paper is to estimate building height from a single monocular[^fn] remote-sensing image.
The authors propose a fully convolutional-deconvolutional network architecture being trained end-to-end, encompassing residual learning. This approach is decomposed into two parts, convolutional sub-network, and deconvolutional sub-network.

The former corresponds to feature extractor that transforms the input remote sensing image into high-level multidimensional feature representation, whereas the latter plays the role of a height generator that produces height map from the feature extracted from the convolutional sub-network.

Normally, LiDAR is used to do the DSM, but for satellite images, the resolutions are very bad and the height estimation from monocular vision poses a problem, as one captured remote sensing image may correspond an infinite number of possible real-world scenarios. This is why deep-learning can help, by training a model on knowing the DSM you may be able to predict a good estimation from a place with no DSM values.


## Summary

- Input: RGB images.
- Ground Truth: DSM.
- Proposal: end-to-end deep residual network (base on the Eigen-Net performance[^fn2]).
