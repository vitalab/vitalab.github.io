# Highlights

- Authors propose an automated data augmentation method for medical images
focusing on the one-shot segmentation scenario for Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) brain scans.
- The model of transforms is learned from the images, and used along with the
labeled example to synthesize additional labeled training examples for
supervised segmentation.
- Rather than removing intensity variations, it enables a segmentation method to
be robust to the natural variations in MRI scans.


# Introduction

Labeling datasets of medical images requires significant expertise and time, and
is infeasible at large scales. These techniques involve costly engineering
efforts, and are typically dataset-specific.

The problem of limited labeled data is exacerbated by differences in image
acquisition procedures across machines and institutions, which can produce wide
variations in resolution, image noise, and tissue appearance.

When large datasets are required in deep learning training contexts,
pre-processing steps and data augmentation are usually required.  

Data augmentation functions, such as random image rotations or random non-linear
deformations are easy to implement, and have been shown to be effective at
improving segmentation accuracy in some settings.  However, these functions have
limited ability to emulate diverse and realistic exam image features.

Authors propose to address the challenges of limited labeled data by learning to
synthesize diverse and realistic labeled examples, using learning-based spatial
and appearance transforms between images in the dataset.

New examples are synthesized by sampling transforms and applying them to a
single labeled example. The method is tested on the task of one-shot
segmentation of brain MRI scans.


# Methods

Each transform is comprised of a spatial deformation field and an intensity
change. The transforms are learned by separate networks to capture the
distribution of anatomical and appearance differences between the labeled atlas
and each unlabeled volume.

The transformation functions' parameters are optimized separately using CCNs:

- The spatial transformation network used is a variant of their
VoxelMorph[^1] with normalized cross-correlation as the image similarity
loss.
- The appearance loss is a Mean Squared Error (MSE) that incorporates a
smoothing regularization term.

Labeled synthetic volumes are generated by applying the transforms computed from
the target volumes to the labeled atlas. These new labeled training examples are
then included in the labeled training set for a supervised segmentation network.

## Data

T1-weighted MRI brain scans from the dataset described in Balakrishnan
*et. al*[^1].

Segmentation maps are obtained using FreeSurfer[^2].

101 scans are randomly selected to be present at training time, and a single
labeled volume is used among these as the label set for the training. 50
additional scans are used as the validation set, and 100 others are used as the
test set.


# Results

The method is compared against four baselines:
- Single-atlas segmentation (SAS)
- Data augmentation using single-atlas segmentation (SAS-aug)
- Hand-tuned random data augmentation (rand-aug)
- Fully supervised segmentation

Consistent improvement of Dice scores across all brain structures are reported.

# Conclusions

Authors demonstrate a method for data augmentation generating new volumes by
sampling spatial and appearance transforms and applying them to the labeled
volume. The synthesized examples are used to train a supervised segmentation
model that shows an improved performance over the compared methods.


# Remarks

- Even if a single labeled instance is used at the beginning, labeled sets are
augmented, so it is not a real single-shot method.
- No comparison to other deep learning-specific synthetic data generation (e.g.
GANs) methods is provided.
- The dataset and/or division used to train the transformation learning networks
is unclear.
