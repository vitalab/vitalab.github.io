## Summary
The authors propose a systematic algorithm for computing universal perturbations to fool image classification networks. The perturbations are shown to work very well across neural networks.

The proposed algorithm has two parameters:
1. The norm of the perturbation to be added to images
2. The desired fooling rate

The idea is to iteratively go over images and build the "universal perturbation" $$v$$ by computing the minimal modification to $$v$$ that causes each image to be misclassified.

## Experiments and Results

**Dataset:** ILSVRC 2012 validation set (50,000 images)

Note that in Table 1, "X" is the training set on which the universal perturbation is computed.
