## Summary

This paper has two main contributions : 
- they show that replacing MaxPooling with convolution layers of stride > 1 gives better results 
- They proposed a guided backpropagation method to visualize the influence of each neuron.

## Replacing MaxPool with ConvLayers of stride > 1

They took 3 basic architectures (Model A, B and C)

and tested 3 different modifications :

Results show that ALL-CNN + model C give best results againts other configurations

while being very competitive againts other similar approaches

## Guided backpropagation

The idea is to use a double relu while backpropagating gradients.
