# Motivation

 * Streamline classification usually requires registration of subject data to a common space.
 * **Contribution**: The main goal of this work is to provide a **rotationally invariant** approach for streamline segmentation based
 on a set of reference streamlines.


#### Main idea

 * Learn the probability of two streamlines to belong to the same bundle.
 * Recognise a streamline by assigning the label of the fiber with the highest similarity in a given set of reference fibers.


#### Rotation invariance

 * Assumption: Similarity between fibers is learned. This is supposed to generalise to

     a. misaligned
     
     b. rotated
     
     streamlines.
     
 * Therefore, applying data augmentation to the reference set is sufficient for achieving rotation invariance.
 (I.e. augmentation independent of the training stage.) 


# Method

 * **FS2Net**:
 
   * stacked LSTMs to arrive at a 32-entry feature vector
   * "L1-distance" between feature vectors
 
     **Comment**: Probably, the authors mean the difference vector.
     
   * classification network: 'similar' vs 'dissimilar'

# Experiments


 * Comparison to two of their own works: *ANN* and *BrainSegNet*
 
   * **Comment**: Doubtful if this can be considered as 'state of the art'.

 * Training:
 
   * BS: 11, 1000 batches per epoch -> only 11K training samples. # epochs: not clear.


#### Nomenclature

 * *macro* classification - Gray matter fibres vs White matter fibres
 
   * probably: U-shaped or short fibres vs long range fibres (?)
   
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/article/images/fs2net/overview.jpg" width="600"></p>

 * *micro* classification - Labelling WM fibres into 8 subclasses

 * *Recall* - fraction of correct WM labels in *macro* classification


#### Data

 * 3 subjects, 250K streamlines each
 * **preprocessing**: keep only 75% of streamline points with the highest curvature (per fibre)
 * each streamline: max of 100 points (zero padded)


#### Registered data

 * *FS2Net* achieves top performance compared to *ANN* and *BrainSegNet* in all experiments.
 * *FS2Net* shows better recall hinting at a better robustness towards data imbalance of GM and WM classes (*macro*).

#### Unregistered data

 * *FS2Net* is quite robust to rotations of testing streamlines.

# Comment

 * Very nice idea. However, for the real value of their approach for streamline segmentation the evaluation is of limited power.
