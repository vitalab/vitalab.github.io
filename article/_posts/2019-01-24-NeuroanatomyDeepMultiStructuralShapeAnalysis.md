# Highlights

- Authors propose a deep neural network for supervised learning on
neuroanatomical shapes.
- Their method works directly on point clouds without requiring a prior
triangulation step; the network learns the optimal representation of the shape
descriptors.
- The method is applied to: (i) prediction of Alzheimer's Disease and mild
cognitive impairment (multi-class classification); (ii) regression on brain age.


# Introduction

Shape analysis of anatomical structures is of core importance for many tasks in
medical imaging.

The use of deep networks in medical shape analysis is still largely unexplored;
among others, because point cloud representations do not possess an underlying
Euclidean or grid-like structure.

Traditional approaches rely on computing pre-defined shape features. The
variational auto-encoder architecture proposed by Shakeri *et al.*[^1]
does not perform an end-to-end training, relies on computing mesh
correspondences and focuses on a single structure.

Authors introduce a method for medical shape data modelling based on
[PointNet](https://vitalab.github.io/article/2018/12/20/pointnet.html),
a deep neural network architecture which operates directly on a point cloud and
predicts a label in an end-to-end fashion. Their method, named Multi-
Structure PointNet (MSPNet), is able to simultaneously predict a label given the
shape of multiple structures.


# Methods

- Two stages
  - Extraction of point clouds representing the anatomy of different structures
  from medical images: segmentation and uniform sampling (i.e. all structures
  have the same number of points).
  - Multi-Structure PointNet (MSPNet). Multi-branch structure, where each branch
  processes the point clouds belonging to a single structure. Steps:
  1) point cloud alignment using a transformation network; 2) feature
  extraction; 3) feature alignment with a second transformation net; 4) dropout;
  5) prediction.

The transformation network (T-Net) is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) estimating a
rigid transformation into a canonical space.

Weights are shared among points in the feature extraction network.

Data augmentation is done applying random rigid transformation to training
points.

Both for the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) *vs.* mild cognitive impairment
classification (MCI), and the age classification task the shape of the left and
right hippocampus and the left and right lateral ventricles are used.

For the age classification task, two experiments are performed: one using only
the healthy controls (HC), and another one including patients diagnosed with
MCI and AD.


# Results

The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ([ADNI](adni.loni.usc.edu))
database MRI T1-weighed 7,974 images (2,423 healthy subjects; 978 Alzheimer's
Disease, and 4,625 mild cognitive impairment) are used.

Results are compared to the standard PointNet architecture and spectral shape
descriptors in BrainPrint[^2].

Additionally, a point importance experiment is performed using the occlusion
method.

# Discussion

MSPNet outperforms the compared methods in all tasks but the age prediction task
when using all subjects (where PointNet showed a better performance).


# Comments

- The segmentation process could be part of the deep learning process.
- The network requires as many branches as structures, which need to be known
beforehand. Also, just those knowing to affect the result are used, which
assumes an *a priori* knowledge.
