Famous 2D image segmentation CNN made of a series of convolutions and deconvolutions.  The convolution feature maps are connected to the deconv maps of the same size.  The network was tested on the 2 class 2D ISBI cell segmentation [dataset](http://www.codesolorzano.com/Challenges/CTC/Welcome.html).  Used the crossentropy loss and a lot of data augmentation.
