# Highlights

The authors propose a novel and effective method based on a single trainable 3D
convolution kernel that enables high quality results with a compact four-layer
architecture and without sensitive hyperparameters for convolutions and
architectural design. Their "one binary extremely large and inflecting sparse
kernel" (OBELISK) automatically learns filter offsets in a differentiable
continuous space together with weight coefficients.

They propose to use a simple coordinate transform geometric data augmentation
strategy for the training.

The architecture has less than $$130000$$ parameters, can be trained in few
minutes with only $$700$$ MBytes of memory and achieves an increase of Dice
overlap of $$+5.5\%$$ compared to the U-Net for CT multi-organ segmentation.

The network trains on a reduced amount of annotated data.

Applied to multi-organ segmentation and image registration.


# Introduction

The specifications of a convolutional network are subject to much manual
design.
training
3D fully-convolutional multi-scale architectures with skip-connection that
excel at semantic segmentation and landmark localisation have huge memory
requirements and rely on large annotated dataset

Authors question the fundamental deep convolutional neural network common
beliefs:
- *More convolutional layers always lead to better results*
- *Small convolutional filters are preferable to larger ones*
- *Multi-scale or progressive dilated receptive field are necessary for dense
 prediction.*

They propose a new single, binary kernel in which both the spatial offsets and
coefficients are learned in a continuous, differentiable space.


# Methods

- $$3$$ layers; $$1$$ sparse convolution followed by either a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) classifier or $$1 \times 1$$ DenseNets.
- 4 kernels/channel.
- The spatial offsets of the kernels are continuously defined and are
learnable.

- They propose a binary extension that learns two offsets for each convolution
element.
- Spatial offsets initialised with normally distributed random numbers.
- Due to the interpolation step, the image locations for which they draw labels
and calculate the large convolution kernel can be on arbitrary
continuous-valued coordinates. This enables them to use randomly selected
patches across different images and locations that may be more diverse than the
entire image batches used in FCNs.

- Leave-one-out validation.

## Data

10 CT scans from the VISCERAL3 dataset[^1]. 7 classes.


# Results

## Multi-organ segmentation

- Compared results to a U-Net architecture with 14 $$3 \times 3 \times 3$$
convolutional layers and 8-128 channels.
- Improved convergence.
- Training using "online hard example mining"[^2]
improves results.
- Coordinate transform geometric data augmentation improves results.

## Registration

- Deformable (2D) registration based on the learned features (trained for a
segmentation task).
- Changes to architecture: filter offsets and convolutional weights remain
fixed, but minimise an $$L_1$$ loss term (on the difference of feature vectors
between fixed and moving image) by changing the sampling coordinates of the
moving image. An additional penalty that penalises the difference between the
estimated deformations and a B-spline filtered version of them is introduced to
obtain smooth deformations.

# Discussion
Their architecture outperforms 3D U-Nets by $$5.5\%$$ Dice overlap for
multi-organ segmentation while reducing the number of parameters by $$90\%$$.
Hence, they suggest that the three common requirements for CNN-based
segmentation (deep networks, small kernels, multi-scale or dilation
architecture) are not always necessarily the best choice.

They mention 3 main benefits:
- The architecture can deal "more naturally" with anisotropic high-dimensional
data.
- Spatial locations for predictions can be adaptively sampled, which enables
more variability in training batches.
- Features can be extracted with true translational invariance and for
arbitrary positions, which can be beneficial for further tasks such as
deformable registration.


# Conclusions
- Spatial context is captured using a large kernel where offsets are learnt
instead of using multiple layers.
- Sparsity in the kernels, much like $$L_1$$ norm regularization would promote.
- Although they claim that their method can deal with anisotropic data, no
results that support the claim are provided.
- Training times are decreased compared to U-Net, the inference for unseen data
takes longer ($$13\times$$). Some limited experiments are presented in an
attempt to overcome the issue.
- If sufficiently large annotated data and GPU resources are available, trying
U-Net architectures may still be better than using OBELISK.
