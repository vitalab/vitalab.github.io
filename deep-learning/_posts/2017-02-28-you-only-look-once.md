## Summary

**YOLO** is a unified solution to the object detection problem. Other approches like **R-CNN** are using a two step process *(localization and classification)* where **YOLO** is a one step process. Also, **Fast YOLO** (or tiny-yolo) is achieving 155 fps where **Faster R-CNN** is doing 18 fps.

On the Pascal VOC-2012 dataset, **YOLO** is achieving 63.4 mAP where **Faster R-CNN** is doing 73.2. In this case, **Faster R-CNN** is not real-time (7 fps) while **YOLO** is doing around 60 fps.

| Model        | Mean avg precision | FPS |
|:-------------|-------------------:|----:|
| Faster R-CNN | 73.2               | 7   |
| YOLO         | 63.4               | 45  |
| Fast-YOLO    | 52.7               | 155 |

It's important to know that **YOLO V1** only supports a **single** aspect ratio, this is fixed in **YOLOV2** with the use of prior boxes and this is the main drawback if we compare **YOLOV1** to Single shot detector (**SSD**). Because we are not using prior boxes, YOLO has no starting point which makes it hard to train.

## Output

Since **YOLO** is predicting multiple boxes per cell, the output is a **dense** layer with *{nb_detection * (4 + nb_classes + 1)}* dimensions. For each cell, the network predicts the boundaries *(x,y,w,h)*, a probability vector of the classes and the probability that there is an object in this cell. *x,y* are relative to the top-left corner of the cell and the *w,h* are computed as the proportion of the entire frame.



## Loss

The loss function is quite simple although there is a lot of parameters that you need to tune.

The values of the predicted boxes are penalized with a MSE if there is an object in this cell.

It is important to know that because **YOLO** predicts multiple boxes per cell,  only the predicted box with the biggest intersection over union (**IOU**) with the ground truth is used to compute the loss.
