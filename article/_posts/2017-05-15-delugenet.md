DelugeNet is some sort of [DenseNet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-03-31-densenet.md %}) but with a series of `blocks` and ``composite layers``.   The layers operating on the same feature map dimensions can be grouped to form a `block`.  The layers inside the block are fully connected as for DenseNet.

The layers inside a block are `bottleneck` layers similar to that used in [ResNet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link article/_posts/2017-03-16-resnet.md %}) (c.f Fig.1(a)).  The configuration of a `block` is shown in Fig.1(c).

<br>

In order to reduce the number of parameters, DelugeNet uses before the bottleneck layer a `cross-layer depthwise convolutional` layer (the red arrow in Fig.1) which concatenates the channels of feature map outputs of many layers, and then applies (channel,spatial)-independent filters to the concatenated channels (c.f. Fig.2).  At the end of a `block` is a `transition` layer made of a `cross-layer depthwise convolutional` layer followed by 3Ã—3 spatial convolutional layer.

## Results

Deluge net is slighly more accurate than Densenet on CIFAR100 (not really on CIFAR10 though) while having fewer parameters.
