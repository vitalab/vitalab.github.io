# Highlights

- NeuroNet is a deep convolutional neural network mimicking multiple popular
and state-of-the-art brain segmentation tools including FSL[^1], SPM[^2],
and MALPEM[^3].
- Produces outputs from raw images, avoiding pre-processing steps (e.g. bias
correction or skull-stripping).
- Reduced processing time by an order of magnitude compared to running each
individual software package.
- Good reproducibility of the original outputs.


# Introduction

The disparity of results in brain tissue segmentation in neuroimaging tools
such as FSL[^1], SPM[^2], and MALPEM[^3] puts neuroscientists before
the dilemma of which tool to choose.

Authors hypothesize that learning a CNN model from multiple gold-standard
reference segmentations would allow to wash out biases and errors.

Also, learning jointly from hierarchical sets of class labels should have the
potential to increase the overall accuracy based on theory derived from
multi-task learning.


# Methods

- An autoencoder is used based on a ResNet encoder and multiple FCN decoders,
as many as the number $$k$$ of output segmentations coming from different
tools.
- Multitask loss: average categorical cross-entropy.
- Each data is automatically segmented using three different state-of-the-art
tools (FSL, SPM and MALP-EM) generating five outputs in total. The
automatically generated label maps from the three tools serve as training data
for NeuroNet.
- For structures that are present in the output of all three tools such as
white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), three
different estimates are obtained (one from each tool) which are all used as
gold-standard reference.
- Compared NeuroNet variants include training
  - on single targets
  - on all targets
  - on tissue segmentations only

## Data

Trained on $$5000$$ T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank Imaging
Study[^4] with data augmentation; $$10$$ validation volumes; and
$$713$$ test datasets.

## Pre-processing

- Input volume size homogenized to $$128 \times 128 \times 128$$ voxels.
- Input volume images normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation
using volume statistics.


# Results

- Comparison metric: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
- Multi-output architectures yielded slightly reduced mean DSC over
training several single networks. May be due to having fixed hyperparameters
across experiments.

# Conclusions

- Trained a single model from these complementary and partially overlapping
label maps.
- Powerful "all-in-one", multi-output segmentation tool.
- The method reduces inference time with respect to the state-of-the-art tools.


# Comments
- Batch size of 1 seems not to be a batch.
- Data augmentation procedure ("random crops of size $$128^3$$") seems
unclear.
- Finally, the proposal of using the whole collection of data for training the
model does not compare well, so it deserves a more fair comparison.
